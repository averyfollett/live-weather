# live-weather
Open source code for a DIY live weather display using JavaScript and JQuery

To see a working example, go to [liveweather.atwebpages.com](http://liveweather.atwebpages.com)

If you would like to use this code for your own project, go ahead, but please use your own API key and replace it in the weather.js and forecast.js files.

Here is documentation on the API I used for [Current](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-current) and [Forecast](https://www.weatherbit.io/api/weather-forecast-16-day)

This will be important for you to swap out my location and API key for yours

To change the background images, just edit the URLs in the background.js file
